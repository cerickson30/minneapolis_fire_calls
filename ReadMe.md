# Minneapolis Fire Calls

Interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app created by [Craig Erickson](https://cerickson30.github.io) to show locations of confirmed fires responded to by the Minneapolis Fire department since January 1, 2012. Also shows the number of confirmed fire calls by fire district, fire station, and neighborhood. The data used in this app was downloaded from [Open Minneapolis](https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/).
